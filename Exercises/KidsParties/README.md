## Scenery 

Rafaela has several children's party themes for rent. She needs to keep track of the rentals and for this she wants
an application that allows her to register: the client's name and telephone number, the start and end time of the party.
In addition, Rafaela offers discounts to some of her long-standing clients. Therefore, she needs to know how much
actually charged for a given rental.
For each theme, you need to keep track of the list of items that make up the theme (e.g. castle, Cinderella doll,
witch, etc.), the rental price and the color of the tablecloth that should be used with the theme.
