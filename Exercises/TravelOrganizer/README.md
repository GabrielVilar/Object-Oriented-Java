## Mini-Scenario
João and Maria are siblings and love traveling together. They have been on short, medium and long duration in Brazil and abroad. 
João, however, always forgets to put something in his suitcase. They are software engineering students and decided to develop an app to help them with the task of packing. 
The application that they have in mind should register their trips and in them store the city and country that
will be visiting, the date they will be arriving in the city, the date they will be leaving the city and the minimum and maximum temperature forecast for the period.
It should also be possible to register items of luggage which must have a name, a description and a photo. An item of luggage can be clothing, shoes or an accessory. 
Clothes must have a name, a description and a photo, the minimum temperature for which the clothing is recommended, and whether the clothing is water-resistant.
A shoe must have a color, type (sport, social, party, casual, etc.) and whether it is water-resistant. 
Finally, the accessory must have a name, a description, type (sport, social, party, casual, etc), and for which area of the body it is intended (for example, if the
accessory is a hat, it is intended for the head; if it is a bracelet, for the wrist and so on).
For each trip, it should also be possible to put together a suitcase which should contain clothes, shoes and accessories, shoes and accessories. 
You should also record the color and size of the suitcase that will be used to contain the items in the suitcase. 
The suitcase should always contain at least a pair of socks and underwear for the number of days they will be in the city, 
a pair of slippers, and pajamas, as these are the items of luggage that João usually forgets to pack.

Considering the mini-scenario, I have drawn up a class diagram and made the code.
